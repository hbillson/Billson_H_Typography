		<h2>ABOUT THE BREWERY</h2>
		<h3>Handcrafted, Small Batch Brewed</h3>

		<p>Nestled in the heart of Muskoka, Muskoka Brewery handcrafts premium beers as unique and refreshing as the region they’re from.<br><br>
		Founders Gary McMullen and Kirk Evans kicked open the doors of Muskoka Brewery in June of 1996. Currently owned and operated by Todd Lewin and Bob MacDonald, what started as a very small and dedicated team has quickly grown to a passionate band of beer lovers more than 130 strong.<br><br>
		In short, we have a passion for great beer and we hope you get a chance to enjoy it.<br><br>

		<p>There is only one Muskoka. It is a special place where rugged granite outcrops and lonely windswept pines meet the shimmering beauty of freshwater lakes. Unspoiled natural beauty is what people find here in Muskoka. This place is our home. It is at the heart of what we brew.</p>
